## Experience

This lab was quite challenging for me. What I had to do to get it to work was take the back end stuff and implement it, and then 
change it ever so slightly so that it would work. I did get there in the end. I also removed the id number because it looked
weird after testing and removing about 15 different tasks, so I removed it from the look however it is still there as a 
whole. overall this lab was fun, it was also extremely challenging. I am glad I got through it though. I also had a fun time 
designing my page, I think it looks great. I changed values for about 15 minutes and decided on what is the end. Overall 
this was a fun lab and can't wait to see waht we do next.
